## Final Project - Maze Runner

For your final project you will be writing the code for "**MazeRunner**", a program that navigates through a given maze. The code for the Maze is already written, and provided in "Maze.java". You just need to write the code that uses Maze and decides how to move through it.

## Part 1 - Let the user solve the maze

For this stage, you will need to do the following steps:

1. Download "Maze.java" and make sure IT IS IN THE SAME FOLDER AS YOUR CODE
2. Create a new MazeRunner class.
3. Create a new "Maze" in your MazeRunner class like so:

Maze myMap = new Maze();

4. Welcome the user to Maze Runner and show them the current state of the Maze. Separate this intro out into a separate method called "intro()".
