Lab Assignment 1

In this lab, you'll get started with support vector classifier by revisiting UCI's wheat-seeds dataset. First, you will benchmark how long it takes to train and predict with SVC relative to how long K-Neighbors took to train and test, and then you'll compare the decision boundary plot produced by the two.

- Start by reviewing the starter code located in Module6/Module6 - Lab1.ipynb and of course the wheat dataset in Module6/Datasets/wheat.data. Be sure to read through everything, so that you know exactly what is being asked of you...
- Add in the KNN and SVC classifiers
- Load up your dataset properly and prune it
- Run the convenience benchmark and plotting functions
