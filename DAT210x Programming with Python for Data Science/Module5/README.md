Lab Assignment 1

Many U.S. cities, the U.S. federal government, and even other cities and governments abroad have started subscribing to an Open Data policy, because some data should be transparent and available to everyone to use and republish freely, without restrictions from copyright, patents, or other mechanisms of control. After reading their terms of use, in this lab you'll be exploring the City of Chicago's Crime data set, which is part of their Open Data initiative.

- Start by navigating over to the City of Chicago's Crimes dataset exploration page. It lists crimes from 2001 to the present, but you'll only be targeting Gambling. The city's website itself has hundreds of other datasets you can browse and do machine learning on.
- Open up the /Module5/Module5 - Lab1.ipynb starter code, and follow the directions to acquire the dataset and properly set it up.
- Fill out the doKMeans method to find and plot seven clusters and print out their centroids. These could be places a police officer investigates to check for on-going illegal activities.
- Re-run your assignment a few times over, looking at your printed and plotted results. Then answer the following questions.
Note: If Pandas complains about your data, you can use dropna() on any row that has NANs in it.
